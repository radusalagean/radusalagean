### Here's what you can expect from me:
- üóìÔ∏è **5+ years of professional Android development experience**
- üëÄ **Trained eyes** in selecting the right tools and architectural patterns for your needs
- ‚ñ∂Ô∏è **Google Play** App publishing
- üìÑ Available for **flexible B2B contracts** (Fixed-term, per project, full-time, etc.)
- ü§ù **Transparent & predictable** workflow.
  <details>
    <summary>Every project has particular needs, but here is a general workflow example we can follow. üîç Click to expand</summary>
    
    - 1Ô∏è‚É£ We **define the scope** of the project, create task definitions and establish delivery and demo milestones
    - 2Ô∏è‚É£ I **estimate the development cost** for the previously defined tasks
    - 3Ô∏è‚É£ While I'm working on your project, I'll regularly **update you** with my progress
    - 4Ô∏è‚É£ Once we reach a milestone, you'll get a **live or pre-recorded demo** where I'll showcase the current state of the app
    - 5Ô∏è‚É£ All invoices come with a **task report** document so you'll know exactly what you're paying for
    - ‚ÑπÔ∏è **You will own the code** I write for you at all times, so you can easily replace me in case you decide I'm not a good fit for your development needs
    - ‚ÑπÔ∏è I accept and embrace **scope change requests** after the initial planning, but they may come at an additional cost, depending on the extra effort needed from my side 
    - üîÑ If you don't have a specific preference, we can use the following platforms to stay in sync:
      - **Slack** (text messages)
      - **Google Meet** (video calls)
      - **Trello** (task definition and tracking).
